### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a backend developer who is interested in python/golang and building out testable and resilient backend systems.

### Here are some projects I worked on:
- Network simulation
- SpaceTraders python sdk
- grpc vs rabbitMQ vs Kafka in low network situations (TODO)

### Clonable boilerplates:
- A project set up with docker (https://github.com/jeffreywu1996/sample-docker-project)
- A project using fastapi and postgres (https://github.com/jeffreywu1996/fastapi-postgres)
- A sample of using semantic release for your project (https://github.com/jeffreywu1996/semantic-release-example)
- A python job scheduler (https://github.com/jeffreywu1996/sample-scheduler)

### Useful Tools
#### grpc
- grpc UI - Postman like UI to interact with grpc requests (https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcui)
- grpcurl - curl like command to interact with grpc requests (https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl)
